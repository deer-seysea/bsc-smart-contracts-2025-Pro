## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of how decentralized and centralized finance interact.

Here‚Äôs a detailed description of how **bsc-smart-contracts** (or any smart contracts on a blockchain like BNB Smart Chain) integrate with major centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.

### The Core Challenge: A Fundamental Divide

First, it's crucial to understand the fundamental architectural difference:

*   **BSC Smart Contracts:** Operate on a **decentralized, public blockchain**. They are transparent, trustless, and interact directly with user wallets. They cannot access private, off-chain data or systems by themselves.
*   **Centralized Exchanges (CEXs):** Operate on **private, centralized databases**. All trading, order books, and user funds are managed within their closed, secure systems. They require API keys for programmatic access.

**A smart contract on BSC cannot directly call the "buy" or "sell" function on Binance's internal database.** The two systems are not natively connected.
